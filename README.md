# Canine Parvovirus Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the prevalence and characteristics of Canine Parvovirus (CPV) using data obtained from NIMET (Nigerian Meteorological Agency) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Veterinary Department, Veterinary Hospital Akure. The analysis will focus on factors influencing the spread of CPV, including weather patterns and environmental conditions.

## Objectives
1. Assess the prevalence of Canine Parvovirus in the study area.
2. Identify environmental factors contributing to the spread of CPV.
3. Determine the peak period of CPV occurrence.
4. Evaluate the survival rate of dogs infected by Canine Parvovirus.

## Data Methodology
### Study Area
The study will be conducted in Akure, utilizing data from NIMET and the Ministry of Agriculture.

## Canine Parvovirus Overview
Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a highly contagious viral infection in dogs that primarily causes acute hemorrhagic enteritis and myocarditis. First identified in 1977, CPV-2 is a significant pathogenic virus with a global presence. The disease is characterized by high morbidity (100%) and frequent mortality (up to 10%), particularly affecting puppies between 6 weeks and 4 months old. CPV-2 is believed to have originated as a host range variant from feline panleucopenia virus (FPV), undergoing genetic mutations that allowed it to expand its host range to infect dogs. The infection is often fatal, and its two clinical forms include enteritis with vomiting and diarrhea in dogs of all ages and myocarditis leading to heart failure in pups less than 3 months old.

## Etiology
The term "parvo," meaning small in Latin, is attributed to CPV, which belongs to the genus Parvovirus and the family Parvoviridae. CPV-2 has a single-stranded negative-sense DNA genome with a length of 5.2 Kb. The genome has two promoters, resulting in the expression of three structural (VP1, VP2, and VP3) and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). The virus has an icosahedral symmetry, is 25 nm in diameter, and is nonenveloped with a linear, single-stranded DNA genome. Replication occurs in the nucleus of dividing cells, leading to large intranuclear inclusion bodies. CPV-2 has spike-like protrusions, a canyon-like depression, and a dimple-like depression in its capsid structure.

## Emergence of Canine Parvovirus Strains and its Distribution
In the early 1970s, a novel infectious disease affecting puppies, characterized by gastroenteritis or myocarditis, was observed globally. CPV-2, closely related to FPV, emerged as a new parvovirus affecting dogs. The virus underwent mutations, leading to the emergence of different antigenic variants, with CPV-2a and CPV-2b being prevalent worldwide. A variant called CPV-2c, differing by one amino acid, was reported in 2000 and has been found in various countries since. The distribution of CPV strains varies globally, with different regions exhibiting varying proportions of CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c.

## Incidence and Transmission
CPV infection occurs worldwide in domestic dogs, with higher incidences in places like animal shelters, pet stores, and breeding kennels. Severe infections are most common in puppies between 6 weeks and 4 months old. All breeds of dogs are susceptible, with some pure breeds being more vulnerable. CPV is transmitted through oral contact with infected feces or contaminated surfaces. It spreads easily through the hair or feet of infected dogs and contaminated objects. Prevention involves avoiding contact with infected dogs, thorough cleaning and disinfection of environments, and timely vaccination. The infection is not transmissible to humans or other species, and if a dog survives the initial infection, it usually gains lifelong immunity.
